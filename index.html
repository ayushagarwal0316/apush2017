							<h2>Gone with the Wind (1939)</h2>
							<p>Based on the novel by Margaret Mitchell, Gone with the Wind is unique for its portrayal of a strong-willed, independent woman and its unusual glorification of the South during the Civil War. The film’s success despite its controversial themes could be due to the beginning of the Civil Rights Era, leading to women’s rights.</p>

							<h2>Citizen Kane (1941)</h2>
							<p>The themes presented in Citizen Kane have proven to be timeless. Telling the story of a man who is granted wealth and opportunity after a life of poverty, Citizen Kane speaks to the contradictory and ultimately hollow ideal of the “american dream”, revealing Kane as arrogant, thoughtless, and morally bankrupt, (causing Kane to lose his fortune, friends, and beloved wife) despite his change in fortune.</p>

							<p>These movies brought along many anti-Russian feelings, and instilled fear into the public against the Soviet.</p>

							<h2>Star Wars: A New Hope (1977)</h2>
							<P>A new breed of the nerds and geeks was created socially, those interested in Science Fiction and outer space, all due to this movie series. Star Wars has become a large part of 'geek' culture, and is seen everywhere even in modern times, with continued releases of movies and rereleases of remastered versions.</p>
							<p>Furthermore, with the Star Wars films, special effects became a box office draw in and of themselves, as viewers were willing to pay just to see the amazing things Lucas’s team at Industrial Light and Magic (including such famous effects wizards as John Dykstra and sound designer Ben Burtt) were able to come up with.</p>

							<h2>The Matrix (1999)</h2>
							<p>The Matrix depicted the sense of detachment from reality that came with internet access, both reflecting and contributing to growing fears of potential hazards of technological advancement in the emerging digital age. </p>
							<p>In addition to setting new trends in sci-fi, The Matrix popularized ‘bullet time’, a visual effect in which action within a scene progresses in slow motion while the camera’s viewpoint appears to move at normal speed, isolating a character and showing greater detail in a split second of action.</p>

							<h2>Avatar(2009)</h2>
							<p>James Cameron’s Avatar marks one of the most revolutionary accomplishments in film technology, a masterpiece championing new heights in 3D and CGI. While the dazzling alien universe earned  $26.7 million in its first 24 hours in theatres, and has certainly had a lasting impact on cinematic technique and Hollywood’s emphasis on special effects, Avatar had little impact on American pop culture.</p>
